## Features

-   Automatically add labels to pull requests eg:- `Approved`, `Merged`

-   Bot will react with `ðŸš€` emoji when a command is found in comment

## Demo

### Automatically adding labels

    -   `bug` - `fixed`
    -   `enhancement` - `implemented`
    -   `feature` - `implemented`

> If these labels are not present in the repo than bot will create them automatically with random color
